I am a second-year Computer Science student at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/scs/) with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving skills. Proficient in both Chinese and English, I have developed a solid understanding of key technologies and concepts through my academic studies.

Backend development is my primary area of interest, and I am eager to apply my knowledge in a professional environment. My academic training at Carleton University has provided me with the tools to develop efficient and robust systems. The opportunity to contribute to innovative projects and tackle complex technical challenges excites me.

Currently, I am seeking backend development roles where I can enhance my skills, collaborate with teams, and make a meaningful impact in the field.
